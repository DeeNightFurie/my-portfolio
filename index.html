    <p>## How a Software Product Team (e.g., Candy Crush) Uses Git and GitHub

When a large team develops a game like Candy Crush, Git and GitHub enable effective collaboration, code management, and quality control across multiple teams (developers, artists, testers, etc.). Here’s how such a workflow typically looks:

### **1. Central Repository Setup**

- The team creates a central repository on GitHub. This serves as the "single source of truth" for the project[1][2][3][4].
- All code, assets, and documentation are stored and versioned here.

### **2. Cloning and Local Development**

- Each team member or sub-team (e.g., UI, gameplay, backend) clones the repository to their local machine using:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/OrgName/candy-crush.git
  ```
- Developers work on their own local copies, making changes and testing features independently[2][3].

### **3. Branching Strategy**

- Teams use a branching strategy to organize work and avoid conflicts[3][5][4][6]:
  - **Main/master branch**: Always stable, production-ready code.
  - **Develop branch**: Ongoing development, integrates features before release[5].
  - **Feature branches**: Each new feature or bugfix is developed in its own branch (e.g., `feature/level-editor`, `bugfix/score-bug`).
  - **Release branches**: Used for preparing a new game release.
  - **Hotfix branches**: For urgent fixes to production code.

  **Example commands:**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/new-powerup
  ```
- This allows multiple teams to work in parallel without interfering with each other’s code[5][4][6].

### **4. Daily Workflow**

- Developers make changes, stage them (`git add .`), and commit with messages (`git commit -m "Add new power-up logic"`)[2].
- Regularly, they pull the latest changes from the central repo to stay updated (`git pull`)[2].
- When a feature is ready, they push their branch to GitHub (`git push origin feature/new-powerup`)[2].

### **5. Collaboration, Code Review, and Pull Requests**

- Developers open a **Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub to merge their branch into the main or develop branch.
- Team leads and peers review the code, suggest changes, and approve or request fixes[1][2].
- Automated checks (like build and test pipelines using GitHub Actions) run on every PR to ensure code quality and prevent bugs[2].

### **6. Merging and Release**

- Once approved, the PR is merged into the main/develop branch.
- Release branches are created for final testing and deployment.
- Hotfix branches are used for urgent issues in production and merged back into main and develop[5].

### **7. Automation and Continuous Integration**

- GitHub Actions automate tasks like building game binaries, running tests, processing assets, and deploying builds to testers or stores[2].
- This ensures every change is validated and the game remains stable.

### **8. Asset and Non-Code Collaboration**

- Non-programming teams (artists, designers) may use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for big assets[2].
- Documentation and design wikis can be maintained in the repo for shared access.

## **Summary Table: Team Git Workflow for Game Development**

| Step                       | What Happens                                           | Tools/Commands                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Central Repo Setup         | Create main repo on GitHub                            | GitHub                             |
| Clone & Local Dev          | Team clones repo, works locally                       | `git clone`                        |
| Branching                  | Create feature, bugfix, release, hotfix branches      | `git checkout -b branch-name`      |
| Daily Workflow             | Edit, stage, commit, pull, push                       | `git add`, `git commit`, `git pull`, `git push` |
| Pull Requests & Review     | Submit PRs, review, run CI/CD                         | GitHub PRs, Actions                |
| Merging & Release          | Merge branches, create releases, hotfixes             | GitHub, `git merge`                |
| Automation                 | Build, test, deploy, asset processing                 | GitHub Actions, LFS                |

## **Branching Model Recommendation**

- **Git-Flow** is ideal for large, multi-team projects like games, as it provides clear structure for features, releases, and hotfixes[5][6].
- **GitHub-Flow** is simpler and may suit smaller teams or open-source projects[5].

**In summary:**  
Using Git and GitHub, a game development team can coordinate work, review code, manage releases, and automate builds, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow even with many contributors and complex requirements[2][3][5][4][6].
